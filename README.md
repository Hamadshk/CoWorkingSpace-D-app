<h1 align="center">CoWorkingSpace D-app 🏢💻🌐</h1>

<p align="center">
    So this is my coworking space D-app which is basically a decentralized application. The software involved are MetaMask and Ganache, and the smart contracts are written in Solidity.
</p>

<h2>Project Overview 📜✨</h2>
<p>
    The project is a website designed for workspace listings, where users can upload listings for available workspaces. These workspaces could be offices, co-working spaces, or any other type of workspace that users might want to rent or share.
</p>

<h3>Features 🚀🔧</h3>

<h4>Upload Listing 📤🏢</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Users can create and upload listings for their workspaces.</li>
    <li>This feature involves creating a form where users can input details about their workspace, such as location, image, and pricing.</li>
    <li>Once submitted, this information is stored on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability.</li>
</ul>

<h4>View All Listings 👀📋</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Users can view all available workspace listings.</li>
    <li>This feature provides a user-friendly interface where users can browse through all the listed workspaces.</li>
    <li>Each listing is displayed with key details, such as location and pricing.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Search Listing 🔍📍</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Users can search for specific types of workspaces based on their preferences.</li>
    <li>This feature involves implementing a search functionality where users can filter listings based on criteria like location.</li>
    <li>Users can quickly find relevant listings that match their requirements.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Upload Review 📝⭐</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Users can upload reviews for workspaces they have used.</li>
    <li>This feature allows users to provide feedback on their experiences with specific workspaces.</li>
    <li>Reviews are also stored on the blockchain to ensure transparency and trustworthiness.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Show Reviews 📢📝</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Listings provide an option to display reviews provided by users.</li>
    <li>This feature helps potential renters or buyers to make informed decisions by reading reviews from others who have used the workspace.</li>
    <li>Reviews can influence users' choices and provide valuable insights into the quality of each workspace.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Technology Stack 🛠️💻</h3>
<p>Your project involves using various technologies:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>: Used for building the frontend of the website, including the user interface and interactions.</li>
    <li><strong>Solidity</strong>: Used for writing smart contracts that handle the logic of storing and retrieving workspace listings and reviews on the blockchain.</li>
    <li><strong>Ganache</strong>: Used as a local blockchain for development and testing purposes.</li>
    <li><strong>MetaMask</strong>: Used as wallet manager.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How it Works ⚙️🔗</h3>

<h4>User Interaction 🖱️💬</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Users interact with the website's frontend to perform actions like uploading listings, searching for workspaces, and leaving reviews.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Backend and Blockchain 💾⛓️</h4>
<ul>
    <li>When a user uploads a listing or review, the data is sent to the backend, where it's processed and stored on the blockchain using Solidity smart contracts.</li>
    <li>Listings and reviews are stored on the blockchain in a decentralized manner, ensuring security and transparency.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Frontend Updates 🔄🖥️</h4>
<ul>
    <li>The frontend periodically fetches data from the blockchain and updates the UI to reflect the latest listings and reviews.</li>
</ul>
